v4l-lua is a small library binding V4L2 CAMERA API to Lua. 
See the example "capture.lua" to see how easy is to capture from V4L2 cameras :D
To compile v4l-lua, you'll need the v4lconvert and Lua development files.

WARNING: THIS LIBRARY STILL IS IN ALPHA STAGE! Plese, report bugs ;)

Usage:

local v4l = require 'v4l'

dev = v4l.open(device_name) -- usually '/dev/video0'
array = dev:getframe() -- table with rgb values for all the pixels
w = dev:width()  -- return width
h = dev:height() -- and height
fd = dev:fd()    -- file descriptor number, if you need it for concurrent I/O with other files
dev:close()      -- closes the camera freeing any resources
